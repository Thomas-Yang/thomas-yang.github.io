**Associate Professor**

*School of Computer Science and Engineering*  
*Sino-German Joint Software Institue (JSI)*  
*Beihang University*  

I am an Associate Professor in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University. I received B.S and Ph.D degrees under supervision of [Prof. Depei Qian](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/8362.htm). I was also a Post-doc researcher in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan. My research interests include high performance computing, performance analysis and optimization, deep learning system and compilation, parallel and distributed computing. My recent research investigates a holistic approach of across-stack optimization for high performance, high scalability and high portability, with special interests in large scale elastic training system, deep learning compilation and auto-tuning techniques, sparse tensor optimization, exascale performance analysis tool and high performance linear algebra for emerging processors. I have authored over 80 scientific publications in the leading international journals and conferences. I received the Excellence Teaching Award from Beihang University in 2016. My research has been funded by NSFC, SenseTime, Alibaba, Huawei, CETC.

I served as Guest Editor of the CCF Transactions on High Performance Computing (CCF THPC). I was the architecture area program co-chair of 23rd IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER), 2021. I currently serve as reviewers in the premier journals including TPDS„ÄÅTC„ÄÅPARCO„ÄÅJPDC„ÄÅFGCS„ÄÅFCS. I am also the supervisor of Beihang Supercomputing Team, which has won the Silver Prize of ASC'17, Bronze Prize of ISC'17, Highest Linpack Award of ASC'19, Application Innovation Award of ASC'20-21, First Class Award of ASC'14, ASC'15, ASC'16, ASC'18, ASC'19, ASC'20-21.
